1. Clone the repository:
    - Create a folder named swe-club on your desktop home
    - Open up your console and use `ls` to list all your folders. 
    - You need to find the `swe-club` folder you created and cd into it by `cd swe-club` this will put you into the folder.
    - Next run the following git clone command down below. this will clone our clubs project into your new folder.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-organization/software-engineering-club-website.git
    ```

    - Verify that your `swe-club` folder has our codebase copied. If you see it is your good to go. 
2. Drag club folder into vscode or cursor:


3. Install dependencies:
    - In terminal cd into club-app by `cd club-app`.
    - once your in club-app, run the command below to install necessary packages

    ```
    npm install
    ```

### Running Locally

Start the development server:
    - You may run into errors if you try to start the server while your not in the correct folder. Ensure to cd into the folder that has our codebase then run followng command below. 

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

- Congrats, you started your first nextjs application

## Collaboration

As a team we will collaborate by pair programming. Tickets/ tasks will be created where you can choose what you will work on. 

## Development guidelines

For the duration of the project we will not work directly into the main. We will always create a sepearate branch to work on our tasks. Once we complete our tasks, you will create a PR and have a PM or I review it and approve it before it gets merged into main.

## Deploy on Vercel

Once we finish our project we will deploy with vercel. 

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
